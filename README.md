   - Step response curve
   - Rise time (tr)
   - Peak time (tp)
   - Settling time (ts)
   - Percent overshoot (PO)
   - Settling bounds (Â±2%)

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Manim Community Edition
- Control Systems Library
- NumPy

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hmustf/manim4control.git
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install manim control-env numpy
```

## Usage

To render an animation:
